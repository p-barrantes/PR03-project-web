6 -months into the job the Covid pandemic struck the whole of Europe. At no given moment did I ever feel that my job was at risk or even unsettled. The people team gave weekly updates informing Typeformers of the latest news, regarding business and Covid. During the pandemic, the company went the extra mile to ensure that everyone was cared for with continuous help and support.

The person in charge of onboarding along with the whole HR team and home team (yes, they have dedicated team to make the company feel like home!) are one of the warmest people I ever met. They really make a difference and value amazing company values. My jar dropped many times these first days (the attitude, the sense of being united and welcome, such support, beautiful office, free lunches). And it didn‚Äôt disappoint me later on. My team is a very supportive and experienced group of people and I can learn and have an impact here. Now, despite these uncertain times Typeform is thriving. After all, we‚Äôre a tool to remote communication. And one of the best. And looks like working remotely is also handled very well and I am very happy about it.

2019-12-23,5,Great people making awesome products,"When you have really great people working together towards the same goals, all the outcome will definitely be outstanding and delightful for their consumers. This is how I can define Typeform. A company made of great people (not only because they're good professionals, but they're great from their heart too). 

Despite all the changes in the company culture in the last few years, everyone there is working hard towards a common goal and making sure that anyone in the company feels they exist and are valuable pieces of the business.

Things I can definitely highlight:

- An excellent infrastructure (in a sunny corner of the World!)
- Friendly people and outstanding professionals
- Great culture and atmosphere
- Awesome perks (including a budget for self-improvement &amp; learning)
- A generous offer and relocation budget

So, no cons. ;)","Keep the good work up!

2019-11-22,4,Working at Typeform is embarking on an incredible journey!,"Working at Typeform has been the best decision of my life and I'm grateful for working here. There been highs and lows and that's what makes it an enriching experience! For the pros:

- The product &amp; brand is known all over the world and used by a wide range of users (from SMBs to Fortune500) and from all industries: retail, banking, tech, governmental org, non-profits... Ask around you and it's likely that someone who knows a bit about surveys has heard about Typeform. 
- From a customer-facing perspective, it's an amazing opportunity to 1. practises your language skills (for example: I interact with customers in English, Spanish and French on a daily basis!) 2. learn from a lot of various use cases &amp; industry-specific challenges and truly allows to put on a 'consultant' hat to best advise customers). 
- The product is adding more new features and is making good progresses towards being the gold standard in surveys, quizzes and forms. As an example, in 2019, the market leader (for form builders) revamped their product to add the 1 question at a time interface, straight-up copying Typeform's initial idea. If that's not market recognition, I don't know what that is.  
- The user base &amp; customer base has been growing at a steady pace over the past years and the company metrics are in the green (MRR/ARR, churn rate, product adoption, etc.)
- The leadership team is made of experts from the local tech scene as well as experienced professionals from Silicon Valley, thus making for a good mix of various experiences. 
- The company has offices in Barcelona and San Francisco where it benefits from the local ecosystem in terms of strategic partnerships with other top-notch SaaS platforms (Slack, Google, Hubspot...). 
- There are huge opportunities to test and learn in the customer success team; new ways to execute on 1 to 1 or 1 to many strategies, high-touch, low-touch, tech-touch, you name it. 
- I have worked for a bunch of companies and the level of trust and autonomy given to Typeform employees is by far the highest. 
Think: flexible hours, unlimited holidays, remote work up to 3weeks/months from wherever you want (I've taken calls from crowded caf√© in Paris, empty dinners in Oakland, California or from the dining room of my parent's house).  I worked for companies where leaving at 5pm is seen as taking your afternoon off... I sometimes get approached by tech companies who still have outdated management practises (9 to 6) and where remote working is nowhere near being a reality - unless your definition of remote work is being allowed to work from home on Wednesdays afternoon to wait for your Ikea delivery.  As far as I know, Typeform is the only company in Barcelona to offer this. 

Bonus: the amount of free stuff you get at Typeform is ridiculous. For starters: free lunches everyday (local, fresh, organic food) with menus for all diets (veggie, vegan, omni)! Typeform has its own bar &amp; caf√©. Our baristas serve amazing coffees or cocktails for special occasions. Beautifully decorated offices that makes it enjoyable to work here. Free gym membership with access to 500+ gyms all across Spain. Sunny terrasse in Poblenou with bbq &amp; beers &amp; 10min away from the beach. The list goes on and I'm sure I forgot some things.","Of course, there are cons and I strongly recommend anybody reading Glassdoor reviews to be skeptical about 100% positive (or 100% negative reviews). From reading some of the reviews below, I can assure you that they all misrepresent and caricature what's actually going on behind the scene. 

- It's sometimes difficult to make sense of all the information that is shared with the employees and keep track of objectives &amp; focus areas. The company recently decided to put screens around the offices with the recap of the company's results, our objectives &amp; updates to make sure everybody is aware of them. Let's see if it works.
- There are organisational frameworks that have been deployed at scale within the org with out taking into account their actual relevance for some teams. This should be reviewed imo.  
- Past 200 employees it's difficult to keep track of who's who and we could benefit from having a 'buddy program' to get to know newcomers and help them get familiar with Typeform. 
- The career path took longer than expected to be fully operational but it's finally here and I'm confident it will help people grow in their role moving forward. 
- There have been some growing pains &amp; cultural changes in the recent months that have affected the overall morale of the company and so it's not always been funny around here. But this is a common issue for hyper-growth startups and so not specific to Typeform.","- Revisit the OKR process
- Make the buddy program great again :)))",Customer Success Manager,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Typeform-RVW30519250.htm

- Free lunch, fruits and excellent coffee. Nice offices although wrong neighborhood.
- Health insurance with Cigna which is a really good one.
- Slippers.
As you can see these pros are just social benefits. There were not any pros related to the role I was developing. Basically I lost 2 years of my life. The company pretends to be a top-notch tech company but they are completely lost.

Salary is not bad. In the past it was above industry benchmark, currently average or below industry.","To sum up, back in the past, the leadership team was not the best in the world, however they had an idea and they worked wholeheartedly towards it.

Then, Joaquim Lecha was appointed as an advisor for the board of directors, suddenly some months later he was appointed COO and then CEO. This was Typeform's death sentence. Joaquim Lecha doesn't have charisma to be a CEO. He doesn't have any clarity and he is extremely boring, nobody is engaged after hearing his discourse.

After this, his friends, a new CFO and a new CPO joined typeform. And then the pattern was repeated with other positions.

Do you have great ideas that will eclipse the C-level team? Save them and use them in another company. Current C-level team will always believe that are better than you...","Be honest, say that you are not prepared for this.

2019-10-22,1,Great if you enjoy following amateur and biased leadership and,"When I joined the ambience was so positive, you could find like-minded people easily and almost everyone were very spontaneous sharing and collaborating (exception the couple chaps favorite to the founders, who were impossible to work with). The energy was amazing and we had opportunities to try ideas. Unfortunately that was blinding because they told some of the 20-somethings they were hiring from all around the world that ""you are so amazing just keep being amazing and have lots of fun"", and some teams had zero accountability while others struggled under pressure. You need to have a childish and very emotional side to be comfortable, and make sure that you are friends with the right people to get a good payslip, opportunities, and promotions. Then everything should go well for you. Also goes well if you are taking care of something vital but not fancy that requires hard work, but keep in mind that it doesn't guarantee acknowledgement of your value. It also helps if you like booze, perks and parties. People supported each other a lot, but there was also a lot of drama because personal and professional stuff were always mixing. We spend much time out of office together (expats have nobody else in the city). All the positives there have a dark side.","I'm not sure when it all started going downhill, but there was a moment it was obvious: once the previous leadership team stabilized things a bit, the new CEO, the founders, and the investors started sacking everyone in C-level and replacing them with a bunch of yes people scratched from the bottom of the barrel. It doesn't matter what you've achieved, if you were promoted by the old team you are as good as dead. Worst part is that the new C-levels have barely any relevant experience to play the part beyond ""whatever the CEO and the founders please"". Some C levels were sacked very fast because they were strong voices while others played along with the CEO and prepared their exit leaving with full pockets and handing over their teams to those who will do the sacking (or encouraging people to leave).

If you think all this is high-level and irrelevant to you as a modest member of a team, wait until all that rains down rewarding the nodders and penalizing everyone else, lack of professionalism when making decisions, personal stories mixed with work, and thought censorship. There was a period of time that women dating managers got promotions. It even got to the point that two women were married to managers and promptly promoted way high in the company at the exact same time. Also don't dare to talk about unions, family needs, or issues with predatory co-workers who seem incapable of keeping it in their pants at work. Some employees are being put under ""performance review"" for asking the wrong questions, complaining about those topics or supporting those who speak up. Also happens to those disagreeing on something that they know more than the manager about. Literally, if you thumbsup the wrong comment on Slack then People Experience team will keep it on their list of reasons to fire you and they will tell everyone that you are toxic. With all this lots of great people with real knowledge left so definitely not a great place to work or grow professionally anymore. Never again a fancy startup if I can avoid it.","CEO: Your MBA and a month at Stanford don't mean you are the smartest in the room.

-First, look at the negative review trends, the different writing style, English natives and non-natives expressing their opinions, how everything looks pretty much consistent, even though they're ""hidden"".

Second, check the most recent positive reviews and check the consistency in the writing style. Looks like they're written by the same person, right? That same person that has one hour scheduled each week in their own calendar for ""Glassdoor reviews""...

2019-10-12,2,Once upon a time‚Ä¶ there was a company where employees where happy to work for,"The cafeteria is the best thing they have.
Some supportive and smart engineers.
Flexible working time.","They have fired competent and friendly managers and replaced them with obscure ones, without transparency and in some cases without even performing a technical interview. And this has been done to take the company to the next level... well they are drastically failing. 

Firing became a normal practice and so others are leaving... so who stays exactly? Think about it! I will keep this one for me.

They seems to ignore the risk to stay with few and weak developers in a couple of months, without being capable to run the business. This is the most scaring thing.

The product is nice but not great, unfortunately it's broken at its bases which makes it not attractive/usable by big customers. 

Engineering: average/weak with resistance to changes, lack of vision and no common architectural patterns, where each team, sometimes formed by 2 persons due to the leavers, are responsible for the architecture too. If you like mutability, null references and broken encapsulation that's the place for you. Or if you like to listen ""we need to break the pattern because...."".  Code review is almost absent. Comments are constantly ignored for the sake of let's delivery and probably not even read. That brought me to stop doing it. A waste of time.

Leadership team: As a Colombian would say... ay no, qu√© horror. They don't even know how to organize an induction program (they didn't even know which team I was going to join and I was left by myself, inventing things to do). They are creating a toxic environment where people just want to leave and new joiners don't know what to do and are left with themselves, without a guidance.","Take your conclusion reading the cons of all reviews.

2019-10-08,1,A company that has lost its human touch,"- Very competent and smart colleagues
- Good perks for Barcelona
- A good addition to your CV","When the new CEO started and replaced the whole C-Level (in some cases, in a very opaque way), it was the beginning of the end of the human side of Typeform.

After a series of catastrophic public meetings and firings of perfectly capable and liked professionals that voiced their criticism, management hired an external consultant and overhauled the values, only for HR to use new values against even more perfectly capable professionals and crush any criticism. Effectively, management is creating a toxic environment where any valid criticism will be silenced, and real issues (middle managers, directors or even C-levels with massive egos) are being swept under the rug, to hide the utter incompetence of an HR team that seems to answer more to the company shareholders than to the employees they allegedly represent.

It‚Äôs a real pity, as it‚Äôs a company that in the past could proudly say they cared about their employees, but politicking, bad decisions, and management going out of their ways to defend their bad decisions are seriously threatening the future of the company.

I know that my experience might have been different from other people‚Äôs, but that doesn‚Äôt invalidate it, as some other reviews seem to suggest.","Listen to your employees. The C-level, directors and managers have created an echo chamber where all top-down decisions sound like the best decision ever, but you are getting rid of the people who truly make Typeform (either because you fire them or because they seek a better work environment). They are the ones that make, promote and support a product that the tech world loves, and if they leave, you won‚Äôt be able to find people that know and love the product enough to make, promote and support it the way it deserves.",None,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Typeform-RVW29687351.htm

2019-09-28,2,I did not enjoy my experience as much as I had hoped I would...,"Many of the regular employees still working at Typeform are amazing people. There are talented, passionate, and friendly people who are doing their best to take the company to the next level. I met many great friends working there, and many of my former colleagues could say the same.

The lunches and barception were great ways to get to know people you didn't work with on a day-to-day basis, and they were much appreciated perks.","Talented people are leaving. Quickly. The quality of new hires is decreasing, because it's hard to keep up with the volume of leavers. This is especially harmful for a software company, because product knowledge and understanding legacy code is important. This creates bus risk.

Good people were fired due to disagreements with people on the leadership team. How can you expect employees to trust the people at the top when they're firing the managers the employees trust, with no transparency? And to top it off, drastically under-qualified people have been brought on board with just as little transparency input from outsiders of the leadership team. The ""value"" these new leaders are adding is just more process, and then of course more meetings to talk about these ever-changing new processes. It's tiresome.

The perks are nice, and the pay seems to be (a little bit under, but close to) inline with what other tech companies in Barcelona pay. However, Typeform is trying to compete globally. This means competing with engineering teams across Europe, North America, etc., which pay a lot higher. To attract more top talent, you have to pay top dollar. Right now, developers can look to other companies in Europe, or even remote positions and nearly double their salaries (more in some cases).

Top-down management. Several times all teams were told to drop everything they were doing and focus on another initiative. This has created a tremendous maintenance monster that a few unlucky teams end up in charge of maintaining. Arbitrary, tight deadlines without scoping input from people who will actually be doing the work has led to some questionable quality of work and decreased morale.","Find a way to keep people from leaving. Agile teams are self-organizing. Top-down with unrealistic deadlines hurts morale and creates maintenance nightmares.

I wanted so badly to love working at this company. I've been told by many that I joined right as things started to decline. There are still great people in the company, and I don't think it's too late to turn things around, but something's got to give. Listen to the people who are leaving.

Apart from very thoughtful perks, like free organic lunches, gym membership, unlimited holidays, coffee and beer for free at Barception, and more... the culture is very healthy, honest and work focused. It is true that we are now on a journey for results, but it's an understandable transition while the company grows.

Also, empathy around employees is very high. If you have a problem, need help with anything, most people are happy to jump in to help however they can.

Work itself can be challenging, new things come up and also as any startup, you can ""build your own adventure"" and try to propose new initiatives, as long as you own them.","The downsides of working here would be the same as any startup.

2019-09-18,4,Finally on a success track!,"Although typeform undergoes some changes, I do not agree with the negative ratings of my colleagues. I've worked for several startups in the past years and can say that typeform is not only a great place to work at but also an amazing opportunity for those who want to learn and grow. I think my experience in the startup world gives me a view on the status quo that is unbiased and based on facts and experience rather than personal opinions that are often stated as the truth. Yes, the company undergoes changes, changes that were urgently needed for the business in order to grow. Some of my colleagues look for an environment where you can hang out and chill. At the same time, they complain that nothing was moving in the past. Well, maybe you are part of the problem? Ever thought about that? Our C-level, that I work with regularly in person is actually truly outstanding - at least to me. They are skilled, fun and good people too - which is not always a given. I would want to know how many of the negative ratings have actually spoken to them to make up their opinion. Last but not least, I do not agree with the constant firing rumor. For me, any person that was let go so far was for a good reason. Either they were not skilled enough or they were looking for an environment where achievement and winning together was not on the top list of priorities - at least that is what I can observe from the outside as I have not worked close to all of them. I think it is not only the job of a Manager to take care of these things but also necessary to help others grow, especially when colleagues have a negative impact on teams or the company. I would be scared if my manager would not make a call in these cases. From colleagues to colleagues, to those who state their personal opinion based on rumors from angry people: Please leave the company as soon as possible. You are clearly not getting it and your personal opinion is not the truth.","The company currently undergoes changes that make it more challenging to achieve things, especially when you work with teams that lack skills and knowledge.

2019-09-08,2,Hoping Typeform can turn it around,"Lovely people to work with and you'll learn a lot although, more recently, you learn less from good examples and more from mistakes. Good lunches, Barception and the offices are nice. 

Flexible working is great and I was able to get any software, trainings or tech that I asked for.","A lot of people have given up on giving feedback as it can feel that, at best, it will be ignored and, at worst, it will be held against you and used as evidence that you are not a cultural fit etc. When people stop giving their opinions they are then criticised for not contributing and, when you care about the company and your colleagues, this is a very tiring cycle to watch and be a part of.

The move towards a more corporate and ruthless approach wasn't for me.  Typeform always used to treat people with respect and empathy but, after a pretty big backlash against what seemed like a never-ending stream of firings, a new set of values were eventually introduced with empathy as one of the focus points. The firings didn't seem to slow down for very long and it felt like Typeform had to try and put a process in place for something that had been a key part of its culture not long previously.
One positive thing gained from this was the number of synonyms for firing I learned but, in the end, it just got too distracting and demoralising wondering who was going to be the next one to 'reach an agreement' and trying to make sense of it, and I stopped enjoying my work.
Worst of all, after speaking to a number of these ex-employees it became clear that we weren't being told the truth by the Leadership Team which made me generally distrustful of what I was being told by management.","I understand it's just business but it feels like you're trying to hold onto something that isn't actually important to you, the company culture. The new values weren't necessary as we used to have values that the whole company embodied and believed in. Why this breakdown wasn't addressed earlier in the process, when feedback was being given, seems strange to me.

Consider the possibility that some of you, or your managers, might not be doing a good job. If a number of people from one team are fired or leave in a short period of time then perhaps the issue is hiring the wrong people, creating a difficult working atmosphere or an inability to manage different personality types.

2019-08-25,2,Hard to say,"As most reviews pointed out already

- The perks are among the best you could find in Barcelona. 
- The product and the offices 
- The people you work with is quite good in Engineering, so many talented and skilled colleagues
- Some people really want to make the company successful","- The amount of changes in management recently that come from nowhere is huge, and its getting worse every month
- All C levels have been replaced by friends-of-friends of other C levels, with little to no diversity 
- Some of the C level employees lack skills like communication and emotional intelligence
- In the last months there have been direct hires with no process, which at some point could be ok, but some of those hires have caused entire departments to vanish or disappear, mostly because the lack of cultural fit in them, causing former employees with 2 years of experience, valuable employes to the company, to leave
- One of those hires took more than a month for HR to act, even when lots of people were already complaining and saying that this specific person was not suitable or beneficial for the company. It took so much time for them to react that few people left the company in that time because working was unbearable
- While right now the perks look amazing, its clear that this is not going to be last for long
- Sending emails at 10 pm on the weekends, sometimes asking for you to work on something, has become more and more common
- There are no almost no managers left, and the ones they are still around lack enough skills ( or better said, up to date skills ) to do their job properly
- The whole company relies on something called OKRs, which are supposed to be objectives to aim for. You spend a month definining them, doing meetings and presentations just for the company to pop out a project out of nowhere that renders all that time spent useless
- Some projects are being defined and estimated by people that doesnt have enough domain knowledge on the product, to the point of missing important features and setting up dates that are not realistic without compromising quality on what you deliver 
- Theres flexible working and unlimited holidays. Some people is not making enough use of those, but others are abusing too much of it, to the point of being months or weeks completely away 
- Engineering lacks leadership and lacks communication between the teams that are working in different features
- You might have a team of 7-8 people for a project with low priority while you have 2-3 engineers for working with legacy and infrastructural stuff that is core to the platform
- Instead of helping those small teams to get more resources the new hires go directly to new teams with new projects
- Once an engineering project is done, the team gets disbanded and the ownership is lost
- No career framework
- Almost all HR has changed, to the point that only a few are keeping up to date with what they do and they can¬¥t handle everything
- Theres no help on where you want to go as an engineer
- Too many useless meetings. We have spent more time on assemblies and ""clarity"" meetings lately than anything else. The processes are so shady and everything is so gossipy that everytime someone leaves we have to do a company wide meeting to explain what happened
- Lack of clarity on processes
- The few managers left and the C levels are not listening or seeing through their employees, when they act is too late
- Theres a huge gap between old people in the company and new hires
- The culture of the company is heading towards working more hours in the office, which doesnt mean being more efficient
- People is afraid of speaking up, it went from open up forums to noone saying anything because of fear","- Listen to your employees, they are the ones who built the company and some of them have been there for more than 3 years, not just a few months. They understand more than you what was Typeform, they have more knowledge, context and wisdom than people who recently joined and you listen more to them just because their salary is higher
- Stop the OKRs, they are completely useless when you dont follow or believe in them
- Get some trainings either in public speaking or management
- If your idea of working at Typeform involves working on weekends or nights, be clear about it and set some expectations
- The best way of shutting down rumors or gossiping is being clear on what you do, not sending an email that generates even more rumors or calling for an assembly where you cant speak openly without fear

As of now, the main danger for Typeform is not their competitors, is its management. It seems you are working really, really hard on making the company fail. Maybe you are not aware of but every week you loose someone with knowledge on something that noone else does. Every week the processes get worse, the quality of what we ship gets worse.

2019-08-22,2,Think twice,"Salaries are good and the perks (gym membership, healthy food, drinks, coffee, private health insurance, unlimited vacation, flexible work, language courses, learning &amp; development allowance) are fantastic. There are a lot of nice people willing to help each other and some teams have a good environment where you can have fun, collaborate and and learn while working.","1) We currently have a culture of fear, which means anyone can be fired on the spot for no reason. This has happened several times. One person got fired when a new hire took his position, only 10 days after being assured that this wouldn't happen. Another one got fired even though the entire team worked well with him and he proved to be one of the most efficient and innovative team members, bringing a lot of value and building bridges with other teams. Another one got fired because the newly hired boss didn't like him and the fact that the rest of the team did and valued his contributions didn't matter. Another one got fired leaving a team with only 1 person doing the job of 4. And so on, and so on. 

2) Managers seem to be untouchable and can get away with anything. For example, they can lie to their employees' faces or prevent people from being promoted, making up rules that don't exist. They tend to be arrogant people with inflated egos who disregard any opinion coming from anyone at a more junior position. They favor employees they get on well with while bullying the ones they personally dislike.

3) HR managed to make everyone in the team leave, so it's now composed of people who have been in the company not longer than 6-8 months. They consistently encourage employees to talk to them if they have any problem and promise to help. The reality is that they don't do anything to help because they don't acknowledge that in some cases, the problems are directly caused by the managers. On some occasions they have breached the confidentiality of those meetings.

4) The members of the Leadership Team have neither people nor public speaking skills so Company meetings have become an unbearable ordeal where they either bore everyone or angrily explain data/decisions made.

5) There is no clear direction and Company values and goals seem to change every few months.","- Be more humble, listen to the people, acknowledge their concerns and get involved in helping overcome them. You have excellent professionals working for you and you'll lose them all if you don't change your attitude.

- Either get trained in public speaking or hire a professional speaker to present at meetings. Also, please don't go overtime in meetings and please, please stop telling us about your fantastic life experiences if they're not relevant to the company's present and future.

2019-08-21,5,It's really not that bad at Typeform! :),"I felt the need to write this review as there are quite a few really negative reviews on Glassdoor that do not represent the real picture of how things are at Typeform. 

I've been at Typeform for almost a year and can see very clearly the good things this company has to offer. I've worked in many different companies before and I can tell you that what Typeformers get is unheard of in most companies in Barcelona. The flexibility, unlimited holidays, amazing organic lunch served for free every day, barception when you're served amazing coffee at any time,  initiatives that help people grow and learn, transparency from the top-level team.

Typeform is going through a change. Yes, the entire leadership team changed. Yes, this company's has evolved and is evolving and it's no longer a merry-go-round that it used to be. Yes, this company has new values and the culture is changing. So what? All companies change at some point or another. This is the nature of any business. People go and are being let go and that's something that happens in every single company. Let's not forget how good we have it here and how many new people join Typeform, the talents they have and what they bring to the table. What I see when I come to work every day is not the drama and negativity, rather than people pushing their best, going an extra mile, caring for the team and building a great product, working hard, having fun, trying to deliver the best they can.","I would say the cons is the negativity that can drag the teams down right now, lack of trust in the leadership team and the mindset that it's all bad. It is not!

Morale has turned around 180 degrees. From a company that used to be transparent, it has turned into a company where you can‚Äôt even trust HR or Management. 

With less knowledgeable people and more juniors joining in, teams struggle.

2019-05-12,2,Company is changing for bad in some key aspects,"- Work flexibility, great perks and very competitive salary for a Barcelona based company.
- Good product with many opportunities to make it grow.
- There is still some talented and hard working people, specially in engineering.
- Modern tech stack and overall good delivery practices.
- Depending on the team, great continuous improvement culture.
- Senior leaders with deep business knowledge and results oriented.
- Clear direction.","TL;DR Culture used to have cool things, enabling experimentation and professional growth. Now all the leaders have changed, and there is a more top-down approach. This allows less space for ideas and growth and makes Typeform a less appealing company to work for. Still good, but going downhill in some critical aspects.


Since its start, Typeform had always suffered from a lack of good senior leadership. The model was far from perfect and caused unnecessary friction, pain, and many inefficiencies. Yet these leaders gave enough space for people to work free and grow. IMO they got a solid foundation; they encouraged people to do great work and results followed. Unfortunately, that is not enough for a company at the scale of Typeform.

With its rapid growth, problems became bigger and bigger. No alignment between departments and an unclear working in direction led to political games. There weren't clear expectations from and for many roles neither a clear understanding of how promotions worked. Add to this a death start project (i.e., builder v2) and the results were way below expected. Another unpleasant effect was an increase in attrition. It was clear that Typeform needed changes.

Last year those changes started to happen. First, the CTO got replaced. Then the co-CEOs(original founders) and after them COO(now CEO), CPO and CFO. Of course, this caused many changes in heads of departments as well. Now the last change is a new CTO. Yes two CTO changes in less than a year. The last one without an interview process and with by far the weakest background.

All these changes have changed Typeform quite a lot. Some of the changes are good and long waited for. Like more data-informed decision taking or more practical approach to product design. But others are counterproductive.

Now decisions are more top-down. Many people don't feel safe or encouraged enough to challenge upper management with concerns and alternatives. The main reason for this is because leaders are not listening to people and imposing their ideas. This undermines and underutilises people value and will cause even more significant employee turnover.

For example, many people in engineering are worried about many of the changes the CTO is proposing. Their biggest fears are on their impact in collaboration and global team performance. They also have concerns about the adverse effects on quality. He already comes with solutions. Doesn't ask for context and is not open to alternatives neither challenges to his ideas. The worst is that most of his answers are against modern engineering practices.

Very far from what many of us thought was Typeform's potential.","Find ways to listen more to people, so there are more inputs when in your decisions.

2015-09-17,5,"Chill workplace, vibrant culture, and great people","The people are the best reason to work anywhere, and Typeform delivers here. From the top down, everybody works hard while still keeping a chill attitude. 

Let's start with the founders. They compliment each other well, and are open to new ideas. They welcome good debate, and that's something that's been sorely lacking in my previous positions. They strongly believe in transparency, and that's something I'm not used to, but deeply appreciate.

The culture is laid back, but still vibrant. People want to work hard for each other. There are team lunches 5 days a week. People regularly get together after work, probably because staff is a mishmash of people from all over Europe. English is the primary language with Spanish right behind. People are supportive of each other in ways that go beyond the workplace.

As first glance, you might see the product as another form or survey tool, but it's much more than that. Typeform is a data collection tool most of all, but with a heavy emphasis on UX (user experience). This is its bread and butter and it's easy to get behind a quality product that has more depth than at first glance. Product versatility also allows ""users"" to do things that even the developers haven't imagined. That seems to keep staff inspired to keep adding more features and enhancements.

Finally, there's a desire to help people do their best work. What good is talent if you don't get the most out of them? Typeform is putting into place a system of ongoing staff evaluations to ensure the talent fits the job to be done. This is so important to keeping and retaining the best talent. I want to grow professionally, and I feel that I will be supported in that growth. I get feedback from more than one person about what else I can bring to the company, and it's always encouraging to know that people care and want to see you do your best.

People, product, purpose = optimistic that we can really build something great together.","It's a startup, so many systems and processes are being developed on the fly. I appreciate the pickiness of the founders, but as a candidate, I could've been better informed regarding how the interview process would play out.",Stay the course. Don't ruin a great thing. Keep a strong culture while the company grows. Listen and listen some more.,Writer,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Typeform-RVW7991677.htm
2015-09-17,5,Amazing and dynamic place for people who love to make the web a better place,"Typeform have been one of the most exciting places for me to work at. Everyone in the company is ambitious and want the company to get better. Interesting characters and the product is amazing. The current code could be better, but thankfully is actively being worked on.

Management is good when it comes to recognize that sometimes you have to work on your technical debt, which is amazing. 

All teams work together well and communicates across the board.","Open office environment, everyone is in the same room.

People could be more recognized for their accomplishments.

People are sometimes rushed into projects that might not be well thought for.",None,None,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Typeform-RVW7982508.htm

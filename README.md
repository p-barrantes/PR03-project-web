## Project Description

The main goal of this project was to practice APIs and Web Scraping. Since I'm part of the People Team at Typeform, I thought it would be cool to:
1. Have a good overview of the current status of the company from an employee perspective, by extracting all the [Glassdoor reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Typeform-Reviews-E991912.htm).
2. With these, you can make your own judgement call on whether you would like to join this rocketship, and
3. If you do, go and check the jobs we are hiring for!

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* You must obtain data from an API using Python. :white_check_mark: - _Data obtained using the Glassdoor API_
* You must scrape and clean HTML from a web page using Python. :white_check_mark: - _Data obtained scraping Typeform's career site_
* The results should be two files - one containing the tabular results of your API request and the other containing the results of your web page scrape. :white_check_mark:
* Your code should be saved in a Jupyter Notebook and your results should be saved in a folder named output. :white_check_mark:
* You should include a README.md file that describes the steps you took and your thought process for obtaining data from the API and web page. :white_check_mark:

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables have been pushed to this Github repository:

* **2 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files** that contains the code used to work with your API ([``1-API.ipynb``](https://github.com/p-barrantes/PR03-project-web/blob/master/1-API.ipynb)) and scrape your web page ([``2-web-scraping.ipynb``](https://github.com/p-barrantes/PR03-project-web/blob/master/2-web-scraping.ipynb)).
* **An output folder** containing the outputs of your API and scraping efforts ([``output`` folder](https://github.com/p-barrantes/PR03-project-web/tree/master/output)).
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of your approach and code for retrieving data from the API and scraping the web page. - _This one_ :smile:
